## Project Overview

Title:Retail sales Data Analysis

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves:

- Setting up a retail sales database
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Answering specific business questions through SQL queries

## Key Objectives

- Build a solid foundation in SQL for data analysis
- Explore and clean retail sales data
- Develop SQL queries to gain insights and answer business-related questions

 ## Project Structure 
### 1.DataBase Setup
### 2.Data Exploration & Cleaning
### 3.Data Analysis & Findings

## Business Questions
The following business questions were formulated to guide the analysis of retail sales data. SQL queries were used to answer these questions and provide actionable insights:

- 1.Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05'.
- 2.Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022.
- 3. a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
- 4.Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
- 5.Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.
6.Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
7.Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out the best selling month in each year.
8.Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales.
9.Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.
10.Write a SQL query to create shifts (Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17) and count the number of orders per shift.
